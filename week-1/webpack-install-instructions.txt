How to install Webpack!
Note: Don't include "" double quotes in command. I only added those since this is a plain text file. Do include '' single quotes.

1. On project root, run "npm init -y".

2. Run "npm install react --save-dev".

3. Run "npm install react-dom --save-dev".

4. Run "npm install webpack --save-dev".

5. Run "npm install webpack-cli --save-dev".

6. Run "code ." to open project root in VSCode.

7. In VSCode, create a "dist" folder at the project root and create an "index.html" file inside.

8. Create a "src" folder at the project root and create an "index.js" file inside. Note: This JS file *cannot* be called "app.js".

9. Start basis of "index.html" file. Add whatever div with id you want. Add a script tag for Webpack at the end of the HTML body:
"<script src='main.js'></script>"
Note: This "main.js" file does not exist yet and HTML will not render in browser yet.

10. Start basis of "index.js" file. Import React and ReactDOM with the following code:
"import React from 'react';"
"import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';"
Add test code to be rendered.

11. In CLI, run "npx webpack". Now the "main.js" file should appear in the "dist" folder you created.

12. Test "index.html" file in browser. If everything went right, your rendered element should appear.
